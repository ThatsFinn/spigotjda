Can't be bothered making this look good..

So you're developing a Spigot plugin with JDA and you're sick of long build times and a huge jar file because you have to export JDA every single time? This is the plugin you need.

How to use:
- Download and put in plugins folder. That's it.

For developers:
- Simply remove the JDA library from your jar and put this plugin in your plugins folder. No additional setup or programming required.

I'll try my best to keep this updated, but if it's out of date please message me on discord at Finn#6955 and I'll update it :)
